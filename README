REVISION HISTORY
    Changes since v0.11:

    0.12 Fri Sep  3 2004 (includes 0.11_xx releases)
	- test for register set as TODO since it seems to fail on some
	  systems when run for the first few times, then suddenly works
	- test for register skipped if not an administrator
	- added test for log4j.NTEventLogAppender interface
	- if backslashes are in the source, it changes them to spaces and
	  issues a warning rather than dying; message changed to
	  'Backslashes in source removed'
	- tweaked tests with respect to opening event log to verify events
	- removed use of Win32::IsAdminUser function, since it does
	  not seem to be universally available
	- added warning in README about WinZip
	- event source will only be registered if one is an admin user
	- removed unnecessary tests
	- updated POD and added Known Issues section
	- corrected tests for registered sources (thanks to
          <fpchan at aol.com> for feedback on this)
