    WARNING: WinZip is unable to use POSIX-style long pathnames in tar
    files, so it may ignore the directory structure of this module's
    distribution.  Alternate gzip and tar utilities can be found at
    http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net or http://unxutils.sourceforge.net

SYNOPSIS
      use Log::Dispatch::Win32EventLog;

      my $log = Log::Dispatch::Win32EventLog->new(
          name       => 'myname'
          min_level  => 'info',
          source     => 'My App'
      );

      $log->log(level => 'emergency', messsage => 'something BAD happened');

DESCRIPTION
    Log::Dispatch::Win32EventLog is a subclass of Log::Dispatch::Output,
    which inserts logging output into the windows event registry.

    See the module documentation for more details.

KNOWN ISSUES
    Depending on event log settings, if they are at their maximum size and
    the automatic purging of older events is disabled, then some of the
    tests may fail.  Clear the event logs and re-test the module.
